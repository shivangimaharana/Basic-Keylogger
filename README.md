# Basic-Keylogger
This is a key logger with basic functionality which doesn't detect num lock, shift, mute and certain special characters. It hides the console window automatically when the application is run. Your prime purpose to code should be to learn and not to harm others. I am not liable if you use this code for illegal purposes.
